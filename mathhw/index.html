<p>I would describe my experience with math rocky, because I had some good teachers, and some captivating teachers, some boring teachers, and some incompetent teachers. My earliest math memory is doing basic arithmetic, like 5+7 and 8-7 on a bench in aftercare.</p>

 Mathematically I would describe myself okay, mr. Gâ€™s class was a nice challenge for me, while mr. holmes class was frustrating and easy (frustrating because he would give a problem like 30*6 then say the answer was something like 100, so I thought I made the error not him)
